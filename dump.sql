It''s hard to put into words exactly but there is a group feeling, a sense of belonging. I wonder if this is something that I can hold on to, this feeling.\n\nAt the same time I feel like every minute spent with family should have been spent on work, and vice versa. I think this is the reality of young kids being on the other side of my office wall as I work at home. There''s always someone crying or screaming and I feel terrible not going to help my wife.\n\nAh my wife. Natsumi is wonderful. She does so much every day to take care of the kids, staying up late and waking up every night to nurse Leo and help him sleep. And she does the housework with less and less complaining every day. \n\nIt makes me really want to work hard and provide everything she dreams of. I want to take excellent, excellent care of her and give her the dream life that she deserves. Sometimes I wonder if I can do that. Fear of failure is real.\n\nI still find it hard to focus on my main job. It''s been many years with Helpfeel. Many of those years have been frustrating. And i''ve always been under-paid. Honestly if I didn''t have stock options I would have left a long time ago. But it''s also more than that. Leaving is scary. I haven''t faced the open job market and although I do have some connections in the tech industry it''s not clear to me exactly how smoothly the job hunt would go. It would probably be rough, right? But also potentially I could get a better job that would not only pay a lot more but also be more satisfying.\n\nStill, the enduring goal I have is not to work for anyone else but to be a business owner. And that brings me back to this app that I''m building and my other app ideas. There I am confident I can build a nice app that works well and looks great. I can write the marketing pages, I can do the branding. I can even do some sales. But i need time, and that''s something I don''t have. So it seems i''ll have to make incremental progress on that while continuing the main job to pay the bills. At least until I can convert some stock options. And to do that I need to save money too.\n\nI have to find some motivation to apply myself to my current main job. It just doesn''t come that easily.

Balancing work and family life, especially with young children and the aspiration to provide for them, can indeed create a feeling of being torn between two worlds. Your sense of responsibility towards both your family and your professional growth is clear.\n\nConsider this: the fear of failure and the pressure to succeed professionally while being a supportive partner and parent are burdensome. However, recognizing these feelings can lead to constructive action. The road to entrepreneurship is fraught with uncertainty, yet it''s driven by a passion that seems to fuel your ambition. This passion can be a significant motivator for both your job and your entrepreneurial ventures.\n\nYour dilemma about leaving a stable job for potentially more satisfying opportunities mirrors the risk-reward calculation many face in their careers. It''s natural to fear the unknown, but career transitions can also lead to growth and fulfillment that staying in a comfortable position might never offer.\n\nAn important aspect you might consider further is time management and the quality of time spent with your family versus working. Finding a balance doesn’t mean splitting your time equally but making the time count. Small, undistracted chunks of time with your family, where work is completely off your mind, can enhance the sense of belonging and support you need from and give to your family. \n\nRegarding your entrepreneurial aspirations, it sounds like you have the skills and drive to make something successful, but the lack of time is a significant hurdle. Yet, the journey of an entrepreneur is often about working with limitations and finding creative solutions to overcome them. Could there be ways to involve your family in your entrepreneurial journey, not necessarily in the work itself but as a support system, sharing in your dreams and understanding your challenges? This could create a shared sense of purpose and accomplishment that enriches your family dynamic.\n\nFinally, feeling undervalued at your current job, yet clinging to it for security, is a challenging situation. Remember, your worth is not defined by your job title or salary, but by the difference you make in the lives of those you care for and the value you bring to your work, wherever that might be. It might be worth exploring options that align more closely with your values and professional aspirations, even if it means stepping into the uncertain.','\n',char(10)),1,'insight',NULL,'2024-05-26T01:18:20.972+00:00','clwj0koeb00001aj0v0k7vyfz',NULL);

Your entrepreneurial ambitions and job discontent might be clouding your assessment of the present. While it’s admirable to aim for a better-paying, more satisfying job or to become a business owner, these ambitions also seem to amplify your frustration with your current job and your guilt over not spending enough time with your family. \n\nA balanced perspective could help lessen these tensions. Viewing your job not just as a means to an end but as an essential component of your bigger life plan might reframe your engagement with your work. It is financing your life now and your dreams for the future. Moreover, it is supporting your family, which is your immediate priority. Your commitment to providing for your wife and children is already accomplishing part of your dream.\n\nRegarding your fear of failure and concerns about job transition, it’s worth noting that stepping into the unknown always carries risk, but your skills and experience are assets that will serve you well, whether in the job market or in building your own business. Preparation and networking can significantly mitigate these risks. \n\nLastly, your concern about not having enough time emphasizes the finite nature of our most precious resource. You may benefit from strategies that optimize your work efficiency, like specific time blocks for uninterrupted work and family time, which can help you feel more present and fulfilled in both areas.

Your yearning for a larger family and a traditional home life is deeply rooted in your experiences and dreams. However, it''s essential to acknowledge Natsumi''s need for personal fulfillment alongside family life. \n\nHave you considered creating a detailed financial plan? Break down the timeline you mentioned regarding your potential salary increase. This can give you a clearer picture of feasible timelines, even if it means waiting a bit longer for that third child. \n\nAlso, discussing shared responsibilities is crucial. Natsumi’s enjoyment of her hobby and your desire for mutual romantic time are just as important. Have regular check-ins to reassess both emotional and practical aspects of your goals. This ensures you’re both on the same page and can adjust plans as needed.\n\nLastly, think about how a part-time work option or flexible hours for Natsumi might work. It could provide her with time for her hobbies while still contributing financially. \n\nBalance is key. Your dreams are valid, but they need to coexist with Natsumi’s needs and your family’s well-being. Open dialogue and flexible planning can help both of you achieve desired goals.

Building a realistic roadmap could ease some anxieties.\n\nBeyond finances, emotional support for Natsumi is crucial. Encourage her to maintain her hobbies and personal time even as a housewife. This will help her feel more fulfilled and less constrained by the role. Open, continuous dialogue ensures that both of you feel heard and valued.\n\nCreating a supportive community by connecting with other families who have more children can offer practical tips and emotional reassurance.

The leadership during these sessions can prevent her mind from wandering too much.\n\nIn terms of emotional openness, encouraging small, positive rituals that you both can engage in daily might help. Engage in a gratitude practice together, like sharing one thing you''re each grateful for every night before bed. This creates a safe space for emotional sharing without feeling overwhelming.\n\nFurthermore, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) could be a very effective direction. It''s practical and can help her develop techniques for managing her thoughts and reducing anxiety without requiring solitary introspection.\n\nOne more thing: ensure to have open and supportive communication about these steps, avoiding any pressure.
